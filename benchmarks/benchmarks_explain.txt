NOTE: the benchmarks are *only* to be considered as relative benchmarks, for development purposes only.
I use them to track relative changes in performance as features are added or refactorings are made.

These benchmarks are not to be construed as guarantees of performance for you, nor as expressing performance
limitations of Funcito.  These same benchmarks run by a Google/Guava engineer on better hardware produced
significantly faster results (1-order of magnitude!).  That is not a performance guarantee either.

Benchmarks are created with a Gradle task to run Google Caliper micro-benchmarking tool.

All benchmarks generated on my lame Toshiba laptop, with WinXP on Intel Core 2 CPU T5200 @1.6 GHz with 2 GB RAM.

Please also notice that performance is significantly better for JVMs running in server mode.
