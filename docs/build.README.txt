Prerequisites:

- Java 1.5 or higher and set JAVA_HOME
- Gradle 1.6
- Technically even Gradle is not needed if you use the gradlew script (gradlew.bat for Windows) which will
retrieve and use the appropriate version of Gradle.

If you choose not to use the included gradlew script, you need to download and install above indicated version of Gradle
(available at: http://www.gradle.org/) and do the following:

- set environment variable GRADLE_HOME to root directory of Gradle installation
- add GRADLE_HOME/bin to the PATH environment variable
- set perms on GRADLE_HOME/bin/*
- add GRADLE_HOME/lib to CLASSPATH environment variable



Commands:
(NOTE: anywhere that it says "gradle" below, you can substitute "gradlew" to use the Gradle Wrapper script instead)
